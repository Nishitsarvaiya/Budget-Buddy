## How To Use?

The Application lets you keep track of your Monthly Budget through calculating Incomes and Expenses. There are 3 input fields for entering incomes and expenses. Once you start entering the incomes and expenses, both are divided into two columns. The total income and total expense is calculated and shown on the top. Each expense also has a percentage value i.e. the occupied amount of total income by this particular expense in percentage.
